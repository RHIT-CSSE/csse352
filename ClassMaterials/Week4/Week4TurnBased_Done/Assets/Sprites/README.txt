"create a sprite sheet which can be divided into 128x128 sprites. Use a simple color palette, and outline the sprites in a black border. Every sprite should have a front view where the character is facing left, and a view from the back where the entity is facing right. These should have the feel of pokemon sprites. Create sprites for these characters: a squirrel, an alpaca, a goblin, and a pet rock with eyes"
